|===
| ID | Scenario

|[[FS01,Tailored to Torg Eternity (FS01)]] **FS01** {fs01-index}
|The system is created for enabling Torg Eternity Games.

|[[FS02,Game Session Organization (FS02)]] **FS02** {fs02-index}
|The software should support in planning, running game sessions.

|[[FS03,Shared Campaign (FS03)]] **FS03** {fs03-index}
|The software should create a shared campaign with a shared timeline following the Torganized Play (((Torganized Play))) concept.

|[[FS04,Data Protection (FS04)]] **FS04** {fs04-index}
|The software needs to be conform to the GDPR in Europe.

|[[CO01,Compatible with FoundryVTT (CO01)]] **CO01** {co01-index}
|The data transfer to FoundryVTT based modules should be as seamless as possible.

|[[CO02,Compatible with torg-codex (CO02)]] **CO02** {co02-index}
|The data from DCIS which is compatible with the torg-codex (((torg-codex))) should be included in the torg-codex.

|[[US01,Web based (US01)]] **US01** {us01-index}
|The main interface should be web based.

|[[US02,FoundryVTT Module (US02)]] **US02** {us02-index}
|The system should have API to support specialized FoundryVTT modules.

|[[US03,Multi Language (US03)]] **US03** {us03-index}
|The system **has to** be available at least in *German* and *English* language.
Other translations **should** be easily addable.

|[[RE01,Working hours 24/7 (RE01)]] **RE01** {re01-index}
|Torg Eternity is played around the world. So the systems have to work 24/7. There is no maintenance window available where no users would be affected.

|[[RE02,12 Factor (RE02)]] **RE02** {re02-index}
|Following the guidelines of 'The Twelve-Factor App'cite:[factor12]  support the maintainability and resilience of the system.

|[[EF01,Fast Response Times (EF01)]] **EF01** {ef01-index}
| Request have to be answered quickly. The following time percentiles are sufficient:
[cols="<.<1,<.<1",width=40%,options="header",frame="topbot",grid="rows"]
!===
!Percentage of requests !Response Time
!95%!1,5s
!90%!2s
!75%!2,5s
!50%!4s
!25%!5
!===

|[[MT01,Small Team (MT01)]] **MT01** {mt01-index}
|Maintaining the software and the data must be possible for a small team (basically the full army of myself, me, and I).
