== Context
{scs} are created to be as indipendent as possible.
But not to implement certain functions again and again some methods should be implemented only once {mt01}.


== Decision
For every SCS handling data there are libraries as defined in xref:08_concepts/asynchronus-data-handling.adoc[] to facilitate the data transfer.
The libraries are listed in xref:05_building_block_view/level_2/dcis-libraries.adoc[].


== Consequences
. The shared libraries break the concepts of {scs}.
. The SCS may be more dependable on shared code.
. The SCS are fully seperated via data synchronization. Only the user creation depends on xref:05_building_block_view/level_1/dcis-users.adoc[]] to be online.
