== Whitebox Overall System

.Overview of the SCS and their transcludes, pages and APIs.
image::dcis-overview.drawio.svg[]

Motivation::
The system tries to separate the concerns of 

* managing the games and campaign,
* providing a character registry (and perhaps in future also a character vault), and
* managing threats.

In addition the functionality of the torg-codex should be provided.


=== Contained Building Blocks

dcis-gaming::
(((SCS,dcis-gaming)))
(((dcis-gaming)))
The gaming gets organized in this SCS.
The mission (((Mission)))s are defined and their play results collected in t his subsystem.
((Game Master))s can add local games to the system to enable a full track of an operative's (((Operative))) history.

dcis-operatives::
(((SCS,dcis-operatives)))
(((dcis-operatives)))
The storm knight (((Storm Knight)))s or stormer (((Stormer)))s (referred to as operative (((Operative)))s of a campaign are managed inside of this SCS.


dcis-threats::
(((SCS,dcis-threats)))
(((dcis-threats)))
The opposition to the Players is known as Threat in Torg Eternity.
This system lets create new threat in addition to the ones defined by the original publishers.
It also creates the famous threat cards out of the data and the image provided by the user creating the threat.

torg-codex::
(((SCS,torg-codex)))
(((torg-codex)))
A rip-off of the original https://torg-codex.com[Torg Codex]. 
A page I really appreciate and that shows the value to a lot of players.
**Best case scenario is that the SCS could still run completely separately without relying on any other SCS (even with another theme for page display).**

dcis-users::
(((SCS,dcis-users)))
(((dcis-users)))
A quite straight forward user management system.
Authentication is offhanded to OpenIDConnect providers.
So this SCS only manages some Out-Game stuff.

dcis-arbitration::
(((SCS,dcis-arbitration)))
(((dcis-arbitration)))
A generic arbitration system to sort out differences.

dcis-commons::
(((SCS,dcis-commons)))
(((dcis-commons)))
The common java script, CSS and images or other resources that are used on multiple SCS.
Helps the browsers to cache by referring the same stuff with the same URL instead of copying it to the different SCS.


=== Important Interfaces

IDs::
IDs throughout the system are ((UUID)), not the simple numbers used by other systems.
Reason is, that the ID should be generated on first creation of an object and UUID is a nice way to handle that distribution.

((FoundryVTT)) cite:[foundryvtt]::
Some SCS declare a FoundryVTT API. This API is not defined yet.
Objective is to offer https://foundryvtt.com[FoundryVTT] modules to integrate with DCIS to enable game play and make it as easy as possible for players to play Torg Eternity.

((torg-codex)) cite:[torgcodex]::
The SCSs containing data types that are also provided by the torg-codex should provide an interface for the torg-codex to include that data.
